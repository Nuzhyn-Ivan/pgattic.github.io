	<h1>Game Removed</h1>
	<p>I've heard that this game was used as a source of discrimination to Noor by some people. Those people will not be named, but as a result, this game will no longer be available here. The intent of this game was originally to be humorous, but that standard wasn't kept. I will try to come up with an alternative that still includes students at the IAM, but is more inclusive. If you still want to play, the Noor game was based off of <a href="https://pgattic.github.io/yeet-ball">Yeet Ball</a>, which can also be found on my site.</p>
	<p>Sorry about all of this, Noor.</p>
