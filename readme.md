# [SaveState's Web Games](https://pgattic.github.io)
Hello, people! welcome to my website source code!

I would just like to say that all my games and other stuff is free for the taking and copying into any of your websites, but I **require** that you give credit to me, including a link to where it can be found on my website!

I have worked really hard on these things, so that is why I ask that you give credit where it belongs.

I don't really have any other remarks to make here other than [go play my games](https://pgattic.github.io)!
