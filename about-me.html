			<p>Hello people! I am SaveState. I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://iamacomb.org" target="_blank">International Academy of Macomb</a> in 2020, and I've been interested in coding for a really long time. I aspire to study computer science in college, and make a job out of it. Thank you for visiting my site!</p>

			<h4>My Story</h4>
			<p>My path towards a career in coding began when I was in middle school. A friend introduced me to emulators by installing <a href="https://iemulators.com/gba4ios" target="_blank">GBA4iOS</a> on my old iPod Touch 4, and after trying it out I instantly was hooked. I absolutely loved using it to play various games, like <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald_Version" target="_blank">Pokémon Emerald</a>, <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3" target="_blank">Super Mario Advance 4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridion_II" target="_blank">Iridion II</a>, and even some ROM hacks like <a href="http://pokemonlightplatinum.com/" target="_blank">Pokémon Light Platinum</a>.</p>
			<p>After some research, I discovered <a href="https://www.emulator-zone.com/" target="_blank">emulators for Windows computers</a>, and started toying with the debugger tools, and began to wonder to myself, "How do people make these ROM hacks?" After a little more research, I found some hacking tools, and began making my own modifications to <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen_Versions" target="_blank">Pokémon Fire Red</a>. I later moved over to NES rom hacks as well. Nothing I made ever got finished or got popular, it was mostly to build my own experience level. This sparked my interest in coding. I wanted more control over these games. I discovered that out of the games you can program in assembly, is is simplest to code games in the NES's assembly language, called <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly" target="_blank">6502 Assembly</a>, due to the nature of graphics (4 colors per sprite). So, coming out of middle school, I knew how to code in 6502 Assembly, and had created a <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/homebrew/111/" target="_blank">simple game</a> with this skill. I also knew basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>, but that was only with a few days of learning (I also learned this all on my own).</p>
			<p>Later, during my junior year at high school, I finished learning GBC assembly, called <a href="https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/Gameboy.php" target="_blank">GBZ80 Asembly</a>, and joined the development team working on two ROM hacks, titled <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=325333" target="_blank">Pokémon Ancient Platinum</a> and <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=417890" target="_blank">Pokémon Ancient Ruby</a> (the sources for both of these games are outdated as of the time of writing). I wasn't the best at GBZ80 assembly language, so my contributions to the game's engine were minimal, but I was responsible for creating the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Distortion_World" target="_blank">Distortion World</a> tileset and the Town Map in Pokémon Ancient Platinum (renowned among fellow developers as two of the greatest-looking graphics in the game), and some overworld sprites for Ancient Platinum and Ancient Ruby.</p>
			<p>Then, towards the end of that same year of high school, I looked into more modern programming languages. It was at this time that I learned that <a href="https://jaxenter.com/most-difficult-programming-languages-152590.html" target="_blank">assembly languages are the hardest to learn</a>, as they are so distant from human spoken language. I realized that I had spent a ton of time learning programming languages that nobody uses anymore, when I could have learned other ones in far less time. At this point, I decided I would learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, which is a far more modern language. I spent that summer learning JavaScript, as well as a little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++" target="_blank">C++</a>. Going back into school, I discovered the GitHub pages feature, and not long after that I expanded my knowledge of HTML and learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and created this website, along with the games in it.</p>
			<p>I want to help those who want to get into video game development, who either have minimal knowledge in coding, or who want to apply their knowledge of coding to game development. So, I have compiled a list of resources which were useful for me. I don't recommend learning any assembly languages, though I will share resources on those topics as well for those who want to learn it anyway.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://archive.nes.science/nintendoage-forums/nintendoage.com/forum/messageviewadfa.html" target="_blank">Nerdy Nights</a>: My favorite NES 6502 tutorial.</li>
				<li><a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_guide" target="_blank">Nesdev tutorial</a>: Another useful 6502 resource.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/Gameboy.php" target="_blank">ChibiAkumas's Z80 tutorial</a>: My favorite place to go for info on GBC hardware, and video and audio registers.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>: Where I learned JavaScript and part of C++ using the free tutorials.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>: The most useful resource for JavaScript and HTML. It is also where I finished learning C++ and where I learned Python.</li>
				<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla's 2D Breakout JavaScript gamedev tutorial</a>: Where I learned to apply JavaScript to game development, a pivotal moment in my coding career.</li>
				<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games" target="_blank">HTML5 gamedev starter</a>: Something I never looked into when I was learning but looking back it seems that it would have been really useful.</li>

			<p>Anyone here trying to learn Spanish? I would like to present <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yaskar/" target="_blank">the IAM's Spanish Tutoring Website</a>, coded by a friend of mine in my graduating class, whom I helped to learn JavaScript, and gave him various useful tips that I learned along my journey. So check that out!</p>
